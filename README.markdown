==============

This is a very simple way to tell iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad(?) users using Safari that they can use two fingers to scroll through a page element that would otherwise have a scrollbar in a full browser (overflow-y CSS property set to something other than none).

Usage

Assuming you're not using anything fancy for your website, just plop the three directories in the repo into your webroot and call the setIosOverlay function from any page in your webroot.
